            Amazon S3 or Amazon Simple Storage Service is a "simple storage service" offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that provides object storage through a web service interface.[1][2] Amazon S3 uses the same scalable storage infrastructure that Amazon.com uses to run its global e-commerce network.[3]
        <p>
            Amazon S3 can be employed to store any type of object which allows for uses like storage for Internet applications, backup and recovery, disaster recovery, data archives, data lakes for analytics, and hybrid cloud storage.[3] In its service-level agreement, Amazon S3 guarantees 99.9% monthly uptime, which works out to less than 43 minutes of downtime per month.[4]

            AWS launched Amazon S3 in the United States on March 14, 2006,[1][5] then in Europe in November 2007.[6]]
